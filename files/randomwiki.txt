Bio of Leopold Neuhauser and his works from Neues historisch-biographisches Lexikon der Tonkünstler , by Ernst Ludwig Gerber, Leipzig, 1813.
Leopold Neuhauser (born Innsbruck, 18th century – died after 1813) was an Austrian musician, composer of instrumental works, and virtuoso of the guitar and mandolin.[1] He lived in Vienna in the early 19th century, where he taught music and composed.[1]

He was part of a "guitar bloom" which ran in Vienna from 1800 through around 1850, as virtuosos from around Austria moved to Vienna.[2] The players began incorporating their regional folk-tunes "alpine influences" into their music, writing Ländler dances and expanding the repertoire of classical guitar.[2] As a guitar player and composer, Neuhauser was part this movement.[2]
